# SORTINGS_JAVA
Bubble Sort 
Idea: if arr[i] > arr[i+1] swap them. To place the element in their respective position, we have to do the following operation N-1 times. 
Time Complexity: O(N2)

Selection Sort
Idea: The inner loop selects the minimum element in the unsorted array and places the elements in increasing order. 
Time complexity: O(N2) 

Insertion Sort
Idea: Take an element from the unsorted array, place it in its corresponding position in the sorted part, and shift the elements accordingly. 
Time Complexity: O(N2)
